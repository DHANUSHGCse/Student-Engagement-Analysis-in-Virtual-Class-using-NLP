# Student-Engagement-Analysis-in-Virtual-Class-using-NLP

## Project Name: 
### VirtualClass Insight: Analyzing Student Engagement through NLP

## Why this Project?
This project aims to address the challenge of gauging student understanding in virtual classrooms. With the shift to online learning, it's crucial to assess engagement and comprehension remotely.

## About Project:
VirtualClass Insight is a Streamlit website where students upload their notes, which are then compared with teacher notes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate an understanding score. This score provides insights into individual student comprehension levels, allowing for personalized interventions and class adjustments.

## Installation:
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Execute `python -m streamlit run main.py` to launch the Streamlit web application.


## Keys to Note:

1. Prototype Status: VirtualClass Insight is currently a prototype showcasing an innovative approach to assessing student engagement in virtual classrooms. While functional, it's important to note that this project is in its early stages of development.

2. Limitations: VirtualClass Insight, as with any prototype, has inherent limitations. These limitations have been thoroughly documented in the associated research paper and report. Understanding these constraints is essential for interpreting the insights provided by the system accurately.

3. Implementation Details : I have not implemented all the modules that i have specified on the paper here i implemented the model which is the curcial part of the project
