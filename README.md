##Project Name: 
###VirtualClass Insight: Analyzing Student Engagement through NLP

##Why this Project?
This project aims to address the challenge of gauging student understanding in virtual classrooms. With the shift to online learning, it's crucial to assess engagement and comprehension remotely.

##About Project:
VirtualClass Insight is a Streamlit website where students upload their notes, which are then compared with teacher notes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate an understanding score. This score provides insights into individual student comprehension levels, allowing for personalized interventions and class adjustments.

##Installation:
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Execute `python -m streamlit run main.py` to launch the Streamlit web application.

Feel free to integrate these changes into the GitHub readme for clearer communication.
